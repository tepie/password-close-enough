Password Close Enough
=============

This is an example implementation that provides feedback if your input password is "close enought"
to your actual password in the data store. Nobody in their right mind should use this on an actual
site as it provides too much information back to a would be hacker (they can do anything by the way).

I've implemented this for fun because I always mistype my passwords and wish sometimes the site
I am entering would just let me in if the password is close enought.
